# Network Measures

This repository contains code related to network efficiency, communicability, and clustering coefficient.

Please note that the codes are written for fMRI functional networks, where the weights represent correlations between pairs of nodes. In this context:

- We have negative weights
- higher weights do not indicate greater distances.

For detailed explanations and alterations in weights, please refer to the attached PDF (efficiency) and follow the comments in the code.

**Note:** Additional functions and features will be added over time.
